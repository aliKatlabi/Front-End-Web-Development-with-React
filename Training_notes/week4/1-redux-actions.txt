Action 
	- is pack of informations sent from the application to the store (using store.dispatch())
	- is JS object 
		# has a type property (type of the Action)
		# the rest is the necessary data (payload)
		
	[you can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application]

to make the actions we can use Action Creators 
	- functions that returns action objects (to be passed to the store using dispatch())
	
Reducer function in Redux 
	# will take the action and previous state and generate new state 
	# will use (switch statment) on the action.type 



SPLITTING REDUCER 

	depending on the shape and fields of state 
		# reducer can be splitted into simpler functions that deals with some of the fields 
		# combining the simpler functions to generate the overall state
