	- make a directory where the server should be locted 
	- move to the location
	- install json-server node module (globally so it can be used anywhere)
		npm install -g json-server 
		
		The json-server also provides a static web server
			
	- make a database json file with varity of objects 
		in our case object's arrays are : dishes , promotions , leaders, feedback
		
	- make the server watch the database on some port 
		json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000
		
		http://localhost:3001/dishes
		http://localhost:3001/promotions
		http://localhost:3001/leaders
		http://localhost:3001/feedback
		
	- also  Any resources that you put in a folder named publicwill be served at:
		  http://localhost:3001/
		 
	- Serving up the Images
		Create a public folder in your json-server folder.
		Download the images.zip file that we provide above, unzip it and move the images folder containing the images to the public folder.
		Restart the json-server as we did before. Now your server will serve up the images for our React app. You can view these images by typing the following into your browser address bar:
		
	http://localhost:3001/images/<image name>.png
