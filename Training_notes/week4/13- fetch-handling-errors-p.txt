.then(resolve, reject)

resolve : in case we have a response from the server 
reject : no response 


- we handle the error in first response after fetching 
	using 
		.then(
		response=>{
			if(ok){return response;}
			else{}
			}, 
        error=>{
            var errmess = new Error(error.message);
            throw errmess;
        )
			
	this will return the response if the first response (from server) was Ok
	
- when error is thrown we have to catch it, and then do some action in react to it by dispatchig 'DishesFailed' with the error message

	chain .catch with fetch .then chain 
	
	.catch(error=>{
		dispatch(DishesFailed(error.message));
		})


 -for comments and promotions we dao the same
