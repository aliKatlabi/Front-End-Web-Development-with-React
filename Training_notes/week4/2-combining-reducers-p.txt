in reducer.js looking at the initialState

	export const initialState = {
		dishes: DISHES,
		comments: COMMENTS,
		promotions: PROMOTIONS,
		leaders: LEADERS
	};

we realize it is obvious that we can split the reducer function into 4 simpler reducers 

we create dishes.js (OR dishesReducer.js) to handle the DISHES substate 

import { DISHES } from '../shared/dishes';


		export const Dishes = (state = DISHES,action)=>{
			
			switch(action.type){
					
				default:
					state;
					
			}
		}

same for COMMENTS , PROMOTIONS , LEADERS 



since we created a reducer for each part of the state

	- we can remove reducer.js 
	- import functions to configuerStore.js  

COMBINING the simpler reducer functions 

	- use the redux method (combineReducers)
		import {combineReducers} from 'redux'
	- use the combineReducers({}) as an argument for the createStore()
