in contactComponent.js
	
we made a localForm where the state of the form was stored in the component state 

in this exercise, we want to move the state of the form to the application store 

in redux folder 
	- we make a forms.js and create object InitialFeedback to save the form's state 
	- we make a reducer out of this object and combine it with the redux store state ,HHHHOW ?	
		
		- making the reducer 
			# using createForm function from 'react-redux-form' to create a reducer 
			# extend the combineForm function with the create form 
			
					    const store = createStore(
							combineReducers(
								{
									dishes:Dishes,
									promotions:Promotions,
									comments:Comments,
									leaders:Leaders,
									...createForm({feedback:InitialFeedback})
								}),
							applyMiddleware(thunk,logger)
						   );
		
		NOTE : the reasone of setting an InitialFeedback is to be able to reset to the inital state of the form when the form is submitted 

		SO : when submitting the form we want to reset the form , WE NEED ACTION FOR THAT 
		
in mainComponent.js
	
		- to do that , we can use 
			actions.reset from 'react-redux-form'
		by adding it to mapDispatchToProps {, resetFeedbackForm: dispatch(actions.reset('feedback'))}
		
		- pass resetFeedbackForm to Contact component props 

in ContactComponent.js 

	- we use the passed props ( resetFeedbackForm()) in the handleSubmit() to reset the form after submission 
	- modify the <localForm> into <Form model="feedback">
		# model name is the same as we declared to be reset earliar
