ContactComponent.js..................................

we will use FormFeedback component from reactstrap
	to show error messages from the form to the user 

in this.state
	we add property touched:{firstname:false, ...} as an object (to keep track when a field is touched)
WHY??
	because we only need to start the validation when the user starts to change the field input

now :
	we create the handleBlue to change the touched state of field (invoked when the field is touched)
		- we triger it using the event [onBlur] in the input 
		
	we create the validate(...) function to create error messages for field that are:
		touched 
		fulfilling condition

THE MAIN THING : after figuring an error is to DISPLAY it 
	using <FormFeedback> after <INPUT>, ..( form inputs )

when the error of the field is empty ==> the input is valid, How to setup this ??
	using valid , invalid properties in the input and update it accordinly
		e.g. valid = {errors.firstname==''}
		
	in reactstrap,Bootstrap =>valid and invalid makes the form lights green or red
