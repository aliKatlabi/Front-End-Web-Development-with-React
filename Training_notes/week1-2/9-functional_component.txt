we may get a warning of a 'Useless constructor' (where the constructor is unnecessary)
	so not all components have to be written as a class extending the Component class
	
	- this suggests that we can make the component functional 
	
converting MenuComponent into funtional :
	- delete the Useless constructor
	- we don't need to extend 'Component'
	- we don't need the 'render' function
	- we can extract group of elements into its own functional component
	
		# like we extracted the Card into RenderMenuItem({dish,onClick})
		# the extracted card can be used as <RenderMenuItem dish={..} onClick={..}/>
		
	- we make the functional component Menu 
	
		# using function Menu(props){...}
		# using arrow function const Menu = (props)=>{...}
