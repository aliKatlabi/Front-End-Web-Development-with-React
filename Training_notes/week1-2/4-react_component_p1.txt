Component : 
	-returns a group of react element to be shown on the screen
	-enables us to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces of code 
	-accepts inputs 
	-different kind of components can be defined 
	
components convention:
	- user-defined components must start with capital letter 	
		to be ompiled into React.createElement(..)
	- tags starting with lower case are treated as DOM tags 
		this trigers react to use some of the built-in components corresponding with the tags 


.................................................. STRUCTURE OF COMPONENT

when making a component we need to follow this :

	- import react and {component} from 'react'
	- make the component class we are making(like Menu) extend the component class 
	- adding constructor (with props as argument) 
		the constructor is constructed using the constructor of component
		meaning super(props)
	- adding the render function which RETURN a group of elements (what needs to be displayed)
	
	- export the component at the end to import it later 
		export default Menu; 	(Menu is the name of component)
	
.................................................... CODING THE COMPONENT

inside the return now we can code what is equal to the bootstrap in react 


 return(
   <div className='container'>
    <div className='row'>
      // Media is reactstrap object
      // one of its properties is list a boolean property
      <Media list>
        {Menu}
      </Media>
  </div>
 );
	 
remember : <div> <Media> .. are JSX syntax mapped to react functions that returns an object with properties like className or list depending on the object ....


Menu is constant we fill it with list of media tags using js functions 


....................................

in the menu list we need to show media display where all have the same properties

SO WE need a place to save these properties 

the best place is in the state property of the component object 
	
	this.state ={ ... };

for example we can define a 'dishes' property as a list of objects of dishes available

	this.state ={ 
		dishes:[ {..},{..} .. //array of object
		]
	};
	
...............................

to fill the 'Menu' const we use array technics (like, map) on the dishes array

		const Menu = this.state.dishes.map((dish)=>{
		
		//for every dish we return the specific layout we need to display
		
			return(
				// it is always a good idea to identify each dish or div tag with a unique
				// key in oreder distinguish it from others 
				<div key={dish.id} className='col-12 mt-5'>
				
						..... look it at component/MenuComponent
						
						// we use {dish.name} {dish.description} ...
				</div>
			);
		})
	
	
This complete the structuring of the menu component

............................................................ HOW TO USE IT

- moving to app.js 

- we import the component we made, by adding :

	import Menu from './components/MenuComponent';

- inside the return of the app rendering we add to a proper place:
	<Menu /> (self closing tag)
