.......................................PART1.............................................

we make a contact component 

in the shared folder ..........

	- we make the following files (to contain constant variables)
		dishes.js 
		comments.js 
		leader.js  
		promotions.js 

in the main component .........
	- import those constants 
	- update the state using these constants

	 this.state = {
		  dishes: DISHES,
		  comments: COMMENTS,
		  promotions: PROMOTIONS,
		  leaders: LEADERS
		};

we need to show the featured dishes has its property (featured: true)

	- using the filter function on the dishes array (in the main component)

	 const HomePage = () => {
				  return(
					  <Home 
						  dish={this.state.dishes.filter((dish) => dish.featured)[0]}
						  promotion={this.state.promotions.filter((promo) => promo.featured)[0]}
						  leader={this.state.leaders.filter((leader) => leader.featured)[0]}
					  />
				  );
				};
	
	
NOW -> the HomeComponent will recieve in the props (dish , promotion, leader) 

in the HomeComponent .........

	- we can now handle those in the HomeComponent by implementing a new component
		<RenderCard />
		
		note: the objects of (dish , promotion, leader) has same properties 
		except leader has two more properties

		like in case of item.designation where it is null for promotion and dish 
		we code it differently
		
		--> {item.designation?<CardSubtitle>item.designation<CardSubtitle/>:null}
		this code in JSX 



.......................................PART2 (Route Parametes)......

in the MenuComponent .....

	we need to update the Card component to pass the dish info as a parameter 
		- we use the Link component <link>
			import {link} from "react-router-dom"
		- enclose each card with a <link to={`..`} > </link> to enable parameter passing 
		- 'to' property allows to pass the URL 
		- in the URL we specify the dish using dish.id 
			Remeber: using back quotes `` inside of {}

	This will provide each Card with a seperate link with different id 


	we introduse Breadcrumps 
		- import BreadCrump , BreadCrumpItem from 'reactstrap'
		- we add it in a row before the {Menu} row 


in the MainComponent ........
	
	we want to define a different view for each dish 
		- we make DishWithId function component as constant	(using arrow function)
			const DishWithId = (..)=>{..};
		- we add the <Route > to each dish using dishId identifier
	Remeber: <Route > components are the way to navigate through pages 
		
		- parameters for DishWithId is ({match,location,history}) //for now it is match only
		- we use the <DishDetail dish={..} comments={..}/> Component we implemented earliar 
	
	Passing the dish to DishDetail props 
		- we want to extract the dishId from match
	
	in match we learned there is params property (contains the parameters passed through URL)
		- match.params.dishid gives the dish [number] (not a string)
		- convert match.params.dishid :: using parsint() function 
		- we filter dishes from state (extract the one that is equal to the number passed using match.params.dishid)
		
	Passing the comments to DishDetail props 
		- from this.state.comments we filter the ones that are related to the dish


fixing the DishDetailComponent ........
	
		- import Link and Breadcrumps
		- change the props to recieve comments from props immidiatly
		-
