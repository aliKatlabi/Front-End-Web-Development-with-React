using the react router we managed to specify pathes as URL

ALSO, URL are able to carry parameters for different usages like:
	- showing a specific part of webpage (like some dish on click) in different view
		menu/42 (42 is a route parameter)
		
the route parameters are specified in the URL as tokens 
	menu/:id 
	(the :id is substituted later with a the value)

.............................. How to implement in react

using <link>
	<link to{`/menu/${dish.id}`}/>
	
Note : enclosing the path is done with back quotes ``


.......................................

the Route component passes three props to the component (being rendered)
	match	 : carries the route parameters inside it as its own properties 
	location : current location 
	history  : for going back purposes 


....................................... match object

the match object enables us to detemin a path
it provides information about how <Route path> matched a URL 

this object is provided with property called (params)
	- params : is key/value 
	- it is fetched (parsed) for the URL (dynamic part where it has somthing like /:id)

for /menu/:id

match.params.id is 42 for /menu/42
