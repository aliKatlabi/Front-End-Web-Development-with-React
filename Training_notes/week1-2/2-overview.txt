As the index.html of the react app suggests we can edit App.js where all the work is done


somthing like this in the react app 
	<header className='app-header'></header>
are called elements which are the basic block that builds a component 
	
.................................

redering the view to the DOM using (from index.js)
	ReactDOM.render( 
	<React.StrictMode> 
		<App /> 
	</React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root'));
	
.................................. JSX

const element = <h1> hello world </h1>;

JSX : 
	- syntactic extension to the javascript
	- with it we can represent functions call that gives(evaluate to) objects


const element = <h1 className='greeting'> hello world </h1>;

	this is mapped to react functions which return an object
	
const element = React.creatElement('h1',{className:'greeting'},'hello world');

	the js object corresponding to this function is 

const element ={type:'h1',
				props:{className:'greeting',children:'hello world'}};
