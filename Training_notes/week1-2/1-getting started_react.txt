we will use Yarn (package manager .. like npm) usfule in the react world (much better and faster still it is ossible to use npm)

To install Yarn -->  https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
OR
	npm install --global yarn

as suggested by the react docs(https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) we need the create-react-app 

	npm install -g create-react-app
OR
	yarn global add create-react-app

at the prompt we can see options
	create-react-app --help 

- navigate to the project folder to create the app there 
then per say make react subfolder and move to it . (mkdir react)
