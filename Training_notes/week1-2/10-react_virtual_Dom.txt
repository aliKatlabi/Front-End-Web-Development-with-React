The Brower DOM is a browser object 

React virtual DOM is a React object 
	it represent the browser DOM
	stored in memory as tree data structure of a plane JS objects 
	extremly fast manipulation comapring the browser DOM
	created completely from scratch on every setState()
	
on changing elements, Reacts will update the  virtual DOM and there will be
	comparing of last and new version of DOM
	deciding which parts needs to be rendered 
	re-rendering those elements

this is done by algorithm called "diffing"
	- it decides the minimum part of the tree that needs to be changed
	- it updates the entire sub-tree if the changed element is of a different type from its old version
	- using "keys" we tell that there is no need to re-render where keys don't change 

A new algorithm is React fiber (faster in performing diffing)
